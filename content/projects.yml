    From August-Demcember of 2019 I interned as a Front-end Developer at [Streem](/streem/). During my time there, I was given the opportunity to redesign the UI for Streems call log. 

    Additionally, I conceptualized, iterated and executed on the creative and visual direction of the new notes feature. As the one of the main frontfacing UI features of Streem, it serves as a sticky note to write out all details you need to remember while the pro and customer are streaming.

    From June-July of 2019 I landed my first internship at [Lightspeed Systems](https://www.lightspeedsystems.com/). As a first project I helped iterate and build out a components-based UI design system for an internal tool known as Relay Support. 

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from JSON files and various micro services.

    From 2015â€“2017 I was leading the UI design & development of all IPDB web properties and additionally iterated on the creative and visual direction of the IPDB brand.

    The main website is a static site built with Jekyll and a custom Gulp-based build pipeline in front of it. All design & development is embedded in a continuous deployment process via GitHub & Travis.
