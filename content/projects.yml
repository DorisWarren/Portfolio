    From August-Demcember of 2019 I interned as a Front-end Developer at [Streem](/streem/). During my time there, I was given the opportunity to redesign the UI for Streems call log. 

    Additionally, I conceptualized, iterated and executed on the creative and visual direction of the new notes feature. As one of the main UI features of Streem, it serves as a sticky note to write out all details you need to remember while the pro and customer are streaming.

    From June-July of 2019 I landed my first internship at [Lightspeed Systems](https://www.lightspeedsystems.com/). As a first project I helped iterate and build out a components-based UI design system for an internal tool known as Relay Support. 

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React.
